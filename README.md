-Goal Statement-
The goal of AmazingTurtle is to create a set of mazes, puzzles, and lessons
to introduce Python programming to middle school students with no prior coding
experience that can be taught by teachers with no coding experience.

-Background-
The concept for AmazingTurtle stems from my time introducing Python Turtle to
middle school students for Honors Volunteering hours at RIT. Each group of
students was taught over two 45 minute lessons. The first consisted of an
introduction to some programming concepts and a tutorial on Turtle commands.
The second day was a review of the concepts and commands, and then a maze
challenge where students all worked to control the Turtle in a maze, collecting
stars and earning candy for their efforts.

The classes were very successful with students staying engaged and beginning to
gain some skills, including debugging their own mistakes. The greatest success
of my time teaching were the students that took their own time to learn more
by downloading Python on their home computers, taking time after school to meet
with me, and continuing to email me with questions. Many students also requested
more puzzles and challenges.

-Current Resources-
Right now there is a very simple maze built with three stars and a home base.
Students attempted to collect all of the stars and return to the home base
while adhering to these rules:

    1. You many not resize the window.

    2. The turtle may not leave the window.

    3. The turtle may not cross its own path.

    4. The turtle must change to the color of any star that it touches.

    5. The turtle may not touch anything other than stars and the home block.

Students solved the maze in solution.py. Solutions must be manually checked for
completion by a teacher. There is also a basic Cheat Sheet of Turtle commands
that are needed to solve the maze, as well as some 'fun' commands that helped
peak student interest. A major challenge of these puzzles is that some students
had difficulties with spelling commands, and with understanding angle measures.

-Development Possibilities-
This project is very open ended. Development is not limited to ideas listed.

    1. Teacher guides to teaching Python Turtle lessons.

    2. 'Circular' grade-level curriculums that will build each year

    3. Grade level puzzles and mazes as fun/practice.

    4. Higher level programming challenges that will teach higher level
        concepts through Turtle. (Ex: variables, loops)

    5. Setup instructions for installing Python at home, easy enough for a
        student, but also include information for parents.

    6. Self-checking mechinism to test for challenge completion.
