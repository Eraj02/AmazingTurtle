AmazingTurtle
=============

A maze built with the Python turtle. Students can gain an idea of programming
 through drawing. The basic premise of the maze is to collect stars and return
 to the starting block again. The rules of the maze act to help introduce
 students with some Turtle commands, gain familiarity with syntax, and practice
 angle measures.

Maze Rules:
    1. You many not resize the window.
    2. The turtle may not leave the window.
    3. The turtle may not cross its own path.
    4. The turtle must change to the color of any star that it touches.
    5. The turtle may not hit anything other than stars and the home block.
